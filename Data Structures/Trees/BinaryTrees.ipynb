    "Binary Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to linked lists, binary trees are another data structure that involve nodes and pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "With linked lists, we connected nodes in a straight line with next and prev pointers. Nodes in a binary tree also have at most two pointers, but we call them the left child and the right child pointers. The first node in a binary tree is referred to as the root node. We draw the pointers down instead of a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a node can be any data type. A TreeNode class would look like the following. Notice how much of the implementation is similar to a ListNode discussed in the linked list chapter, except these nodes are considered children.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a node does not have any children, it is classified as a leaf node. If a node has even a single child, either left or right, it would be classified as a non-leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike linked lists, binary tree node pointers can only point in one direction. As such, cycles are not allowed in binary trees. Mathematically speaking, a binary tree is a connected, undirected graph with no cycles. This means that a leaf node is always guaranteed to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Node\n",
    "Root node is the highest node in the tree and has no parent node. All of the nodes in the tree can be reached by the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaf Nodes\n",
    "Leaf nodes are nodes with no children. The nodes at the last level of the tree are guaranteed to be leaf nodes but they can also be found on other levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The children of a node are its left child and right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of a binary tree is measured from the root node all to way to the lowest leaf node, just like the height of anything in real life. The height of a single node tree is just 1, if the node itself is counted, or 0 if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the height is counted by the number of edges that are in between the nodes instead of the nodes themselves. Using this method, the height will be n-1 where n is the number of nodes, in the path from the root to the lowest leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum height of the given binary tree in the visual below is 3. Alternatively, if we were counting by edges, instead of nodes, it would be 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ancestor\n",
    "A node connected to all of the nodes below it is considered an ancestor to those nodes. For example, the root node is an ancestor to all of the nodes in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descendent\n",
    "The descendent of a node is either child of the node or child of some other descendent of the node."
