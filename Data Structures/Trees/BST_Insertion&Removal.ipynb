    "Insertion and Removal from a Binary Search Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned previously that the main benefit of using BSTs over sorted arrays is that we can perform removal and insertion in O(log n) time. This assumes that the tree is balanced. Let's discuss these two operations in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wish to insert a new node into the BST, we first have to traverse the BST to find the right position, and then insert this node. We must make sure we maintain the sorted property of the BST, just like we would with a sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a BST [4], and wish to insert 6, this could be done in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [4,null,6] where the root is 4 and right child is 6\n",
    "2. [6,4,null] where the root is 6 and left child is 4\n",
    "Both of these would be valid BSTs. In the first example, we added the 6 as a leaf node, which is an easier process than the second example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add 5 to the first scenario tree [4,null,6], which results in [4,null,6,5,null].\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the current node is null, we return a new node with the value val.\n",
    "2. If the value is greater than the current node, we recursively call the function with the right child of the current node.\n",
    "3. If the value is less than the current node, we recursively call the function with the left child of the current node.\n",
    "4. We return the current node after the recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we return a new node if the current node is null. This is how we add a new node to the tree. Even in the recursive case, we return the current node after the recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the return values from the recursive calls are assigned to either the left or right child of the current node. This is how we maintain the tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the insertion operation is O(log n) if the tree is balanced. This is because we continue until we reach a leaf node and thus the number of nodes we visit is proportional to the height of the tree."

    "Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Before removing a node from a BST, we need to consider two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The target node has 0 or 1 child\n",
    "2. The target node has 2 children\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1 - The target node has one child or no children\n",
    "If we wish to delete node 2, which has no children, the left_child pointer of 3 now points to null.\n",
    "If we wish to delete node 3, which has one child, the left_child pointer of the root node will point to 2 instead of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2 - The target node has two children\n",
    "If we wanted to delete a node with two children, say, 6, we replace the node with its in-order successor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The in-order successor is the left-most node in the right subtree of the target node. Another way of looking at it is that it is the smallest node among all the nodes that are greater than the target node. This will ensure that the resulting tree is still a valid binary search tree."
