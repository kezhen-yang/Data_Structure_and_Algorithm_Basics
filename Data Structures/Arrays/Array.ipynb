    "Static Array VS Dynamic Array \n",
    "\n",
    "Static array because the size of the array cannot change once declared. And once the array is full, it can not store additional elements. Some dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript do not have static arrays to begin with. They have an alternative.\n",

    "Read from an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "To read an individual element from an array we can choose the position we want to access via an index.\n",
    "Accessing a single element in an array is always instant because each index of myArray is mapped to an address in the RAM. Regardless of the size of the input array, the time taken to access a single element is the same. We refer to this operation as O(1) in terms of time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traversing through an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use for and while loop to read all values within an array by traversing through it.\n",
    "To traverse through an array of size n the time complexity is O(n). This means the number of operations grows linearly with the size of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting from an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "In statically typed languages, all array indices are filled with 0s or some default value upon initialization, denoting an empty array.\n",
    "When we want to remove an element from the last index of an array, setting its value to 0 / null or -1 is the best we can do. This is known as a soft delete. The element is not being \"deleted\" per se, but it is being overwritten by a value that denotes an empty index. We will also reduce the length by 1 since we have one less element in the array after deletion. \n",
