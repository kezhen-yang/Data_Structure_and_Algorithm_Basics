    "A stack is a data structure that supports a subset of operations from a dynamic array. With a stack you may only add and delete elements from one end of the array (referred to as the top of the stack).\n",

    "Stacks are a dynamic data structure that operate on a LIFO (Last In First Out) manner. The last element added to the stack is the first element that comes out. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stack supports three operations - push, pop, peek.\n",
    "\n",
    "The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, which in dynamic array terms would be appending an element to the end. This is an efficient O(1) operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pop operation removes the last element from top of the stack, which in dynamic array terms would be reading and removing the last element. This is also an efficient O(1) operation as discussed previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peek operation is the simplest. It simply returns, the top element without removing it. This is also an efficient O(1) operation."
