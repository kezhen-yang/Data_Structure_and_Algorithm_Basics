    "\n",
    "A linked list is another data structure that is like an array in the sense that it stores elements in an ordered sequence. But there are also some key differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that linked lists are made up of objects called ListNode's. This object contains two attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. value - This stores the value of the node. It could be a character, an integer, etc.\n",
    "2. next - This stores the reference to the next node in the linked list. The picture below visualizes the ListNode object. This will make more sense a little later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "By chaining these ListNode objects together we can build a linked list. We start with a ListNode class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the next pointer of each, we can connect the nodes together. Suppose that we have three ListNode objects – ListNode1, ListNode2, ListNode3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we would need to make sure that our next pointers point to another ListNode, and not null. Only the last node in the linked list would have its next pointer point to null.\n",
    "\n",
    "ListNode1’s next pointer points to ListNode2. Next, we set the next pointer for ListNode2 and ListNode3.\n",
