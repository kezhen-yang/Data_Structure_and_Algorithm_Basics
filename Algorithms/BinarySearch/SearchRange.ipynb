    "Imagine you picked a number from 1 - 100 and asked your friend to guess the number you were thinking of. There are three outcomes. Either their guess is correct, too small or too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "After every guess, you would tell them if their guess was correct, too small or too large. Your friend would then adjust their next guess accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, this is a binary search problem. As long as there is a way to determine if the number is too big, too small or correct, we can adjust the search space accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many problems, comparing the guess to the target is done by a predefined function or some math equation. For example, in this problem assume we are given a function isCorrect(n) that returns 1 if n is too big, -1 if n is too small and 0 if n is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now use this function to element binary search. We calculate the middle of the search space and pass it to the isCorrect function as our guess. Depending on the return value, we adjust our search space accordingly."
