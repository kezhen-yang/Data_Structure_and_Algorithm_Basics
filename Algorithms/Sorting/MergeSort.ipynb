    "Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort is an extremely common sorting algorithm that is used by many programming languages as apart of their standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind it is very simple. Keep splitting the array into halves until the subarrays hit a size of one. Then recursively sort the subarrays by merging two subarrays at a time. The final array will be fully sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a technique that is known as divide and conquer. We divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them and then combine the solutions to get the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is two-branch recursion, similar to the fibonacci sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an array of size 5 as an example, [3,2,4,1,6]. We want to sort it in an increasing, or non-decreasing order if we had duplicates. We will be splitting the array like the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a base case where if the length of the array is less than or equal to \n",
    "1. we return the array because it is already sorted.\n",
    "2. Otherwise we calculate the middle index of the array.\n",
    "3. We recursively call mergeSort() on the left half of the array. We do this by passing pointers s and m to the function, which in this case represent the start and end of the left half of the array.\n",
    "4. We recursively call mergeSort() on the right half of the array. We do this by passing pointers m + 1 and e to the function, which in this case represent the start and end of the right half of the array.\n",
    "5. We merge the two sorted halves by calling the merge() function, which is discussed more below."

Recall the following pseudocode from the merge() subroutine."
