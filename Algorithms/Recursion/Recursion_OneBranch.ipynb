    "Recursion (One Branch)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is when a function calls itself, usually with a different input. This is known as a recursive function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions can be thought of as functions that breaks down a problem into smaller sub-problems and solves them in reverse order. It's usually possible to convert a recursive function into an iterative one, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some problems an iterative solution can be much more simple to implement than a recursive one, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions have two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The base case.\n",
    "2. The recursive case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of recursion applies to the real world as well. Consider a box that contains another box, which contains another box, and so on. This is a recursive structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the base case would be the smallest box, and the recursive case would be the larger boxes that contain the smaller boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of recursion, one-branch and multi-branch. Let's discuss one-branch recursion first.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to computer n! (n-factorial), we can use recursion. The formula for n! is n∗(n−1)∗(n−2)∗...∗1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 5!=5∗4∗3∗2∗1=120.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Notice that 5! can be broken down into 5∗4!\n",
    "2. 4! can be broken down into 4∗3!, and so on. This is the recursive case.\n",
    "3. The base case is when n=0 or n=1. The result of 0! and 1! is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze this. We have our two parts: the base case and the recursive case (the function calling itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the code reaches the last line with the initial input of 5, we get: 5 * factorial(4), which starts executing the function again from line 1, only now with input 4, so we get 4 * factorial(3) and then 3 * factorial(2) and lastly 2 * factorial(1) after which the base case is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part is that when we trigger the base case, we move back \"up\" the recursion tree because now we have to \"piece\" together the answers to our sub-problems to get to the final solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complicated part about this is you have to think about the problem in reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that if there is no base case in recursion, the recursive case would execute forever resulting in a stack overflow error."

    "Space: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "While we aren't using any data structures, recursion operates off of an implicit stack, known as the function call stack. That is how we are able to return from one function call to the previous one. Since there are n recursive calls, there will be n function calls placed on the stack, which results in O(n) space."
